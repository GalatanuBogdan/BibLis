# BibLis
The project that creates a graphical representation for dynamic data structures, like linked and double linked lists, queue and stack.
This project was homework from my computer science faculty. I created this with one of my colleagues, Bogdan Puscasu. We managed to separate the project in 4 parts:
1)simple linked list made by Puscasu Bogdan
2)double linked list made by Galatanu Bogdan
3)stack made by Puscasu Bogdan
4)queue made by Galatanu Bogdan
The project was created in graphics.h, an old graphics library for c++ projects. If you don't have installed the library, we created a video inside that covers all the app functionality
